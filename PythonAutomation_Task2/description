*File Description: File Organization Automation*
Objective:
This Python script automates file organization by sorting files into folders based on their types.

*How It Works:*

1. Organizes files from the Downloads folder.
2. Creates folders like Images, Documents, Videos, etc., if they don’t exist.
3. Moves files to respective folders based on their extensions.
4. Displays a confirmation message for each moved file.

*Example Folder Structure:*

~Before:
Downloads/
├── photo.jpg
├── report.pdf
├── video.mp4
~After:
Downloads/
├── Images
│   └── photo.jpg
├── Documents
│   └── report.pdf
├── Videos
│   └── video.mp4

*Usage:*
Copy the Automation.py script to your system.
Update the source_folder path if needed.
Run the command:
python Automation.py
Future Enhancements:
Add error handling.
Include logging for better tracking.
Schedule the script for automatic execution.
